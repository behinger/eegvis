The example dataset is the face group fMRI data that is available from the [SPM website](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/data/face_rfx/). This dataset is described in more detail  in:

Henson, R.N.A, Shallice, T., Gorno-Tempini, M.-L. & Dolan, R.J (2002).
Face repetition effects in implicit and explicit memory tests as measured by fMRI.
Cerebral Cortex, 12, 178-186.

Here we use the data from the 2nd-level canonical HRF model, the analysis of which is described in the SPM manual in section 29.3.
